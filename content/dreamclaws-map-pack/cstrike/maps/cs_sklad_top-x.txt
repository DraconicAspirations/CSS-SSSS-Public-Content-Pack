Hostage Rescue mission

Background story:
There was a terrorist attack on a military warehouse! There are the new secret weapons of armed forces. First wave of attack was stopped & the remaining terrorists have taken hostages & demanded a helicopter. 
 
Terrorists: You must take care of the hostages - they are your guarantor of success. If you are attacked, resist as much as you can!

Counter-Terrorist: The state does not negotiate with terrorists. Attack the bandits! Save as many hostages as possible.

Notes: In the block of terrorists there are two hostages under balcony.  Another hostage is upstairs on the balcony. And the last hostage is downstairs, near the locked door.
