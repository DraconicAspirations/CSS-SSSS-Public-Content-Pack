Counter-Terrorists:
  Intel indicates that a terror cell is laundering money in an
  abandoned warehouse in eastern America. Sadly, both laundering
  money and openly being a  terrorist is against state laws,
  so instead of meeting them and bragaining crack pricing we are
  going to shoot them dead.

Terrorists:
  State Police tracked us down. Kill their recon squad, load all
  the money into the incoming cargo train and get the fuck away.


Notes:
- Created November 2008 for a contest on thewall.de. Fixes,
  balance and additions from August 2010
- There are grenades in the central hall vent, shoot the
  grates and they fall out
- There is a buyzone in the middle of the tracks
