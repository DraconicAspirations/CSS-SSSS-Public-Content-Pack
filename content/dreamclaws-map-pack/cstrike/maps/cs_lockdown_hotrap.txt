CS_Lockdown_Hotrap (hot traps)
- Hostage Rescue mission

Terrorists stormed the prison and freed the other dangerous criminals. They took as a hostages of some prison staff who survived.
In order to prevent the antiterrorist forces to easily enter, the terrorists completely mined the prison with explosive barrels, thereby making the "hot traps".

Counter-Terrorists: Enter into the mined prison, liquidate the terrorists and rescue the surviving hostages.

Terrorists: Prevent rescuing the hostages! Use wisely the hot traps to destroy or do much harm for anti-terrorist forces. Be careful that by yourself don`t get into the hot trap.

Notes: Hostages are on a ground floor and with a floor above.
Some bots can blow themselves the hot traps and may die (sometimes should clear the way for them).
If you accidentally killed your partner, then in the next round you will not be involved.
