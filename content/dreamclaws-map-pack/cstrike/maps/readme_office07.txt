*** cs_office07 READ ME FILE ***


** Installation:

You should have no trouble extracting the contents of the zip to your cstrike folder.

(eg steamapps\your-email\counter-strike source\cstrike)

Failing that use the folder structure in the zip to see where the files need to go.

** Map Details:
cs_office07 is a 100% re-make of Turtle Rock's cs_office, no copy and pasting - map was built from scratch 
brush by brush.

Map was started in October 06 and has been worked on and off since then, total compile time 1 hour approx.

No known bugs at the time of release, have play tested it to death and I don't plan to release another 
version unless it starts crashing servers by some obscure stroke of no luck.

The bot nav file can be a bit ropey at times, I have adjusted it somewhat but they aren't perfect, 
get some friends instead.

You can contact me via http://www.interlopers.net/index.php?page=contact.php regarding anything about
this map, or just pop onto the forums and tell me how great I am.

** Thanks:

Steve, for helping me test the shit out of it at 3am
Al, for testing and being rubbish so I can get kills galore
Jake Parley for his mini trailer
Interlopers forum members, some really decent feedback, pointed out many retarded things that I would 
have left in otherwise.

Anyone that plays this and has a laugh, cheers.
